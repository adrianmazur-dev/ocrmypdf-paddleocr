# OCRmyPDF-PaddleOCR Bounding Box Fixes

This document describes the bounding box improvements implemented in the PaddleOCR plugin for OCRmyPDF.

## Overview

Two critical issues with text bounding boxes in the hOCR output were identified and fixed:

1. **Horizontal Issue**: Word bounding boxes were too short, leaving ~150px gaps at line ends
2. **Vertical Issue**: Line bounding boxes included unnecessary padding from min/max calculation

## Fix 1: Word Width Calculation (Horizontal)

### Problem

When selecting text in the PDF, word bounding boxes were significantly too short. For example, on a 934-pixel-wide line, words only covered 784 pixels, leaving a ~150px gap at the end.

### Root Cause

The bug was in the word width estimation algorithm (lines 312-342 of `plugin.py`):

```python
# BEFORE (buggy):
total_chars = sum(len(w) for w in words) + len(words) - 1  # Included spaces
word_width = int(line_width * len(word) / total_chars)     # Divided by total with spaces
space_width = int(avg_char_width * 0.3)                     # Only allocated 30% back
```

The algorithm included spaces in `total_chars` when calculating word widths, but only allocated 30% of average character width back for spaces. This caused approximately 14.46px per space to be "lost", accumulating to ~145px over 10 spaces.

### Solution

Modified the algorithm to properly separate word character allocation from space allocation:

```python
# AFTER (fixed):
total_chars = sum(len(w) for w in words)  # Exclude spaces from character count
# Calculate space width separately
total_space_width = line_width - total_chars * (line_width / (total_chars + num_spaces))
space_width = int(total_space_width / num_spaces) if num_spaces > 0 else 0
# Width available for actual word characters
word_area_width = line_width - (space_width * num_spaces)
# Calculate word width using only the word area
word_width = int(word_area_width * len(word) / total_chars)
# Make last word extend to line end to avoid rounding errors
if i == len(words) - 1:
    word_x_max = x_max
```

**Location**: `src/ocrmypdf_paddleocr/plugin.py:306-343`

### Results

- Word bounding boxes now extend to the full line width
- Zero gap at line ends
- Proper proportional allocation for both words and spaces

## Fix 2: Vertical Bounds Using Polygon Edges

### Problem

Line bounding boxes had excess vertical padding, with the highlight extending too far above and below the actual text.

### Analysis

PaddleOCR returns 4-point polygons for each text line. The original code used min/max of all Y-coordinates to calculate bounding boxes:

```python
# BEFORE:
ys = poly[:, 1]
y_min = int(min(ys))
y_max = int(max(ys))
```

This approach includes any slight rotation or skew in the polygon corners, adding 1-3px of padding on each side.

### Solution

For horizontal text, PaddleOCR's 4-point polygons have a specific structure:
- Points 0-1 define the **top edge**
- Points 2-3 define the **bottom edge**

By averaging the Y-coordinates of each edge, we get tighter bounds that follow the actual text baseline and top:

```python
# AFTER (polygon edge method):
if isinstance(poly, np.ndarray):
    poly_scaled = poly * [scale_x, scale_y]

    # For horizontal bounds, use min/max
    x_min = int(poly_scaled[:, 0].min())
    x_max = int(poly_scaled[:, 0].max())

    # For vertical bounds, use polygon edges for tighter fit
    if len(poly_scaled) == 4:
        y_min = int((poly_scaled[0][1] + poly_scaled[1][1]) / 2)
        y_max = int((poly_scaled[2][1] + poly_scaled[3][1]) / 2)
    else:
        # Fallback to min/max for non-standard polygons
        y_min = int(poly_scaled[:, 1].min())
        y_max = int(poly_scaled[:, 1].max())
```

**Location**: `src/ocrmypdf_paddleocr/plugin.py:277-301`

### Results

Analysis of actual text from test documents:

```
Text: 'Ein- und Zweiobjekthaus i.S.d. § 1 Abs 2 Z 5 MRG'
  OLD (min/max):     height=53px
  NEW (poly edges):  height=51px
  ✓ Reduced by 2px (3.8%)

Text: 'Vermieter:'
  OLD (min/max):     height=49px
  NEW (poly edges):  height=46px
  ✓ Reduced by 3px (6.1%)

Text: 'MA Theresa Rosna'
  OLD (min/max):     height=49px
  NEW (poly edges):  height=47px
  ✓ Reduced by 2px (4.1%)
```

Typical reduction: **2-3px (3-6% of height)**

### Why This Approach

This is a **data-driven approach** that uses PaddleOCR's actual polygon geometry rather than guessing percentage-based padding values. It provides the tightest possible bounds without clipping actual text.

## Testing

Test script to verify the improvements:

```bash
# Generate test PDF with polygon edge method
nix-shell --run 'ocrmypdf -l deu --plugin ocrmypdf_paddleocr /tmp/test_page.png /tmp/test_output.pdf'

# Compare bounding box methods
nix-shell --run 'python3 /tmp/test_bbox_comparison.py'
```

## Technical Notes

### PaddleOCR Polygon Structure

PaddleOCR returns polygons in this format for horizontal text:

```
Point 0 (top-left) -------- Point 1 (top-right)
       |                           |
       |        TEXT HERE          |
       |                           |
Point 3 (bottom-left) ---- Point 2 (bottom-right)
```

The polygon may have slight rotation/skew, which is why averaging the edges gives better results than min/max.

### Coordinate System

- Origin (0,0) is at top-left of image
- X increases rightward
- Y increases downward
- All coordinates are scaled from PaddleOCR's resized image back to original resolution

### Word-Level Estimation

PaddleOCR provides line-level detection only. Word boxes are estimated by:
1. Splitting text on whitespace
2. Allocating horizontal space proportionally by character count
3. Using the same vertical bounds for all words in a line

Note: PaddleOCR 3.2.0+ has a `return_word_box` parameter for native word-level boxes, but it's not available in the 3.1.1 version used here.

## Files Modified

- `src/ocrmypdf_paddleocr/plugin.py` - Lines 277-343
  - Vertical bounds: lines 277-301
  - Horizontal bounds (word estimation): lines 306-343

## Related Issues

- Word bounding boxes were too short (fixed)
- Line bounding boxes had excess vertical padding (improved by 3-6%)

## Future Improvements

1. **Upgrade to PaddleOCR 3.2.0+**: Use native `return_word_box` parameter for accurate word-level detection
2. **Character-level boxes**: PaddleOCR can provide character-level boxes for even more precise selection
3. **Baseline detection**: Use PaddleOCR's text direction/angle detection to handle rotated text better
